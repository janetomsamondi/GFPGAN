# GFPGAN
GFPGAN aims at developing a Practical Algorithm for Real-world Face Restoration
GFPGAN is a blind face restoration algorithm towards real-world face images
This Generative Facial Prior (GFP) is incorporated into the face restoration process via novel channel-split spatial feature transform layers, which allow it to achieve a good balance of realness and fidelity.
I use this model to restore my late Grandma's face, and the results gives me a very emotional experience seeing a once radiant face that i saw many years ago.
I continue to use AI in my daily life,not only academical but also emotionally.
